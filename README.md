#### The Official Repository for the CC Bridge Causality Tutorial @ AAAI 2024

---

The Code Tutorial is a `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) file. You can easily run this online using `Google Colab`. Details on running the tutorial:
1. Open a Google Colab session. 
2. Select runtime "GPU" if wished. 
3. Then add the remaining local files from the git repository to the runtime (otherwise the dependencies break). These files are the ones ending in `.py` and `.csv`.
4. Then simply run and enjoy :heart_eyes:
