#### The Official Repository for the CC Bridge Causality Tutorial @ AAAI 2024

---

The Code Tutorial is a `.ipynb` (Jupyter Lab / Notebook) file. 

You can simply download / clone the repo and then use your local `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook` to run the code cells. :heart_eyes_cat:

Alternatively, you can easily run this online using `Google Colab`. Details on running the tutorial:

1. Open a Google Colab session. 
2. Select runtime "GPU" if wished to boost neural net training speed.
3. Then add the remaining local files from the git repository to the runtime (otherwise the dependencies break). These files are the ones ending in `.py` and `.csv`.
4. Then simply run and enjoy :heart_eyes:
